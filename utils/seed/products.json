        "description": "Innovative 3D Navigation – This is a real-time, three-dimensional navigation system for ENT procedures performed in the operating room and or ENT office. The electromagnetic image-guided navigation system is used for endoscopic sinus procedures and surgeries like Balloon Sinuplasty which treats chronic sinusitis. This device incorporates microsensor technology, innovative tracking hardware and software tools to enable precise placement of surgical instruments and devices relative to the patient’s preoperative CT scan.",
        "use": "Various padded components attach to the patient’s head and emit an electromagnetic field with magnetic sensors that the console used to create 3D imaging. Padding attaches to chair doubling as a padded head/neck rest, and additional sensory padding is placed on the forehead. A Registration Probe is used to trace the pre-acquired image to the patient’s head at the beginning of the procedure and mark corresponding points. Workstation also comes with console, instrument hub, and Instrument Adapter acting as physical connection interface between the instrument Hub and the navigated surgical device.",
        "benefits": "This is the best device on the market today hands down regarding procedural visual aid. This state-of-the-art device provides visual assurance without invasive techniques. Complete sinus surgery in office using minimal procedural technique trusting this device to enable you to clearly operate by full visual capacity."
